# A Sparse Random Feature Model for Signal Decomposition

A repository with supplementary materials and code for my master's thesis.

See the [SRMD repository](https://github.com/GiangTTran/SparseRandomModeDecomposition) for the main code related to the Sparse Random Mode Decomposition algorithm and associated paper.
